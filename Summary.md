● Goal: Describe your project. 
Our Goal : This project is based on creating a productivity extension for Mozilla Firefox's Browser. We are planning to build a firefox
extension that will help users to maintain focus, clarity and time management while trying to sustain a more productive lifestyle. User personas
include students with heavy workloads, business managers, project managers etc... Users will find this software useful
because its very easy to get distracted. We plan to build this extension using one main programming language. Different components of this extension will be
a pomodoro timer etc... We anticipate coding challenges such as figuring out how to make things work. Our work will be divided by our teammates strengths
capabilities to make the process smoother.

○ Your users - we need 2 to 3 convincing user stories, reasons that a person derive value from your software that believably link up to the product design.
